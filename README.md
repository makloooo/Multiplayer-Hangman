# Multiplayer-Hangman
Computer Networks Project from CS164 in University of California, Riverside

A simple game of hangman that is configured only to run on lab machines, since it was developed for a class.
Is currently configured only for localhost, but is a code sample only to demonstrate projects written in Python.

For those of you looking at this to copy the code onto future projects in this class, please do it yourself. It'll help you learn a lot, and this is a rather messy implementation that I'm not too proud of either. Thanks.
