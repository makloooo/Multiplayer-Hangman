# Multiplayer-Hangman
Computer Networks Project from CS164 in University of California, Riverside

A simple game of hangman that is configured only to run on lab machines, since it was developed for a class.
Is currently configured only for localhost, but is a code sample only to demonstrate projects written in Python.
